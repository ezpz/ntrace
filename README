ntrace is a tool that allows one to capture the running behavior of a process
as that behavior relates to netowrk activity. This is very much like what you
can do with strace (by a much different approach, however).

So then, why not just use strace with '-e trace=network'? The reason is that
strace does not understand the context of the executing process outside of 
the system call interface. For instance, one is free to read from an open 
socket with either of the following calls: read or recv. However, strace will
only capture (with trace=network) the recv version since the context is 
attached to the socket not the call.

ntrace works by injecting a shared library shim (via LD_PRELOAD) and 
intercepting calls to particular functions. By managing what the process is
doing with the socket interface ntrace is able to determine what calls are
related to network activity and process only those details.

ntrace will follow child processes.
